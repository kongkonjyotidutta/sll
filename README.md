# sll
SLL Repo
This a C language implementation of Single Linked List data structure.
The various operations that are allowed on SLL are:
a) Insert a node
b) Delete a node
c) Traverse the linked list
d) A menu driven interface to interact with these functions

A bunch of other user defined functions will be added as we grow along like count() to count the number of nodes in 
the list etc.
Future improvements
a) add function to add a node at the end,
b) reverse the sll
c) traverse backwards
